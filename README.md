<h3>Morse Code in text</h3>

<p>There is an input field at the top of the screen where you can enter dots using the space bar (on the keyboard) 
  (by pressing the space bar quickly) and a dash (pressing the space bar for a longer time). If there is a short gap between the input, 
  a space is automatically placed - a new letter, if the gap is longer - a '|' is placed, which means a new word.</p>
<p>After entering the desired text, after clicking the "Translate" button, a translation from Morse code into Russian will appear at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h3>Second</h3>

<p>Everything is the same here as in the first tab, but a lighter version. There is no countdown for automatically inserting spaces and '|'. You control all this yourself!</p>
<p>To separate one letter from another, press the 'n' key, and to separate one word from another, press 'w' key.</p>

<h3>Third</h3>

<p>Now we enter the text from above, and from below we get this text in Morse code (with voice acting!).</p>

<h3>Fourth</h3>

<p>The last tab is training. In the field, you need to enter what this character will look like in Morse code and click "Check". If everything is correct, you will move on.</p>
<p>If you can't remember, there's always a "Hint" in the bottom right corner!</p>
